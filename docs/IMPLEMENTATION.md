# ResQ implementation guide

## Delivered system

The repository now runs the full software workflow without external simulators:

1. A seeded fast-mode scenario generates traffic, incident, sensor, and signal conditions.
2. Crowd probes can be sampled with adoption, GPS noise, dropout, and upload lag.
3. Historical and graph-smoothed forecasting baselines predict edge speeds.
4. Perception converts tracked vehicles and LiDAR clusters into queue/blockage observations.
5. Confidence-aware fusion produces the travel-time estimate used by routing.
6. Route hysteresis prevents switches unless both the 10-second and 5% thresholds are met.
7. The deterministic signal state machine preserves minimum green, amber, and all-red.
8. B0–B5 experiments are recorded in SQLite and aggregated with p95 and 95% confidence intervals.
9. FastAPI publishes controls, snapshots, adapter status, experiments, results, and ghost replays.
10. The React app provides functional Live, Replay, Cab, and Results workspaces.

Interactive OpenAPI documentation is available at `/docs` while the server runs.

## External modes

The three external adapters are implemented but activate only when their dependencies exist:

- SUMO: run `sim/chennai/build_network.py`, manually verify the imported network, then pass
  `sim/chennai/chennai.sumocfg` to `SumoTraCIAdapter`.
- CARLA: install the Python API matching the CARLA 0.9.x server. `CarlaSensorRig` enables
  synchronous 20 Hz mode and attaches a 1280×720 RGB camera plus 32-channel, 70 m LiDAR.
- Google Routes: set `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`. The server requests traffic-aware alternatives,
  static and live duration, encoded geometry, and traffic speed intervals at runtime only.

These adapters intentionally fail with `AdapterUnavailable` rather than silently substituting
data. `/api/adapters` tells the UI and operator exactly which modes are ready.

## Research integrity

- Every stochastic result includes a seed and baseline identifier.
- Baselines toggle only their documented capabilities.
- Google data is never used as training history.
- Targets in the planning document remain targets, not claimed measured outcomes.
- Results from the built-in mesoscopic runner validate software integration; final reported
  transport claims should come from the manually verified Chennai SUMO network with 20+ seeds.
- Conflicting-green violations are explicitly recorded and must remain zero.
